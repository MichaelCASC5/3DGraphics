# 3DGraphics
A 3D graphics framework software I am currently developing in Java.

*** HOW TO USE ***

Go to Driver.java in the "src" directory. You can run it with the terminal command "java Driver.java"
Although to be sure, you can compile it as well, with the terminal command, "javac Driver.java; java Driver.java"



Use the WASD keys to move around, and the arrow keys to look around. Use the control key and the spacebar to move up and down.
As of now, the models will only draw in wireframe mode.

You can drag and drop any .obj model (I've provided some) into the directory titled, "Scene 1," and it will render in the engine.


Thank you!
