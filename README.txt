# 3DGraphics
A 3D graphics framework software I am currently developing in Java.

*** HOW TO USE ***

    Launching the Program:

        Double click on the run.bat file to execute the program.
        It is also possible to execute it via the command line.

        Alternatively:

            Navigate to the "src" directory in the command line. There you will see many ".java" files.

            Use the command: javac *.java; java Driver.java
            This will compile and execute the code.

    Using the Program:

        Use the WASD keys to move around, and the arrow keys to look around. Use the spacebar and the control key to move up and down.
        As of now, the models will only draw in wireframe mode.

        You can place any .obj model (I've provided some) into the directory titled [Scene 1], and it will render in the engine.

Thank you for checking out my projects!
