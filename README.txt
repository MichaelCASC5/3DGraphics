# 3DGraphics
A 3D graphics framework software I am currently developing in Java.

*** HOW TO USE ***

    Launching the Program:

        Navigate to the "src" directory in the command line. There you will see many ".java" files.

        Use the command: javac *.java; java Driver.java
        This will compile and execute the code.

    Using the Program:

        Use the WASD keys to move around, and the arrow keys to look around. Use the control key and the spacebar to move up and down.
        As of now, the models will only draw in wireframe mode.

        You can drag and drop any .obj model (I've provided some) into the directory titled, "Scene 1," and it will render in the engine.


Thank you for checking out my projects!
